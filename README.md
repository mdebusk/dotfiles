# My configuration files ("dotfiles") for Linux

## What this repo is for

- [The best way to store your dotfiles: A bare Git repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)

## My hardware

- [ASUS ROG G75VW-AH71](https://rog.asus.com/articles/hands-on/asus-g75vw-gaming-laptop-overview/) laptop purchased in August 2013

## Some of the software I use

- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) 22.04.5 LTS "Jammy Jellyfish". Ubuntu 6.06 "Dapper Drake" was the first Linux distro I could get to install on my weird hadware at the time, and I've just kept using it because I haven't found a reason to switch. I'm thinking of switching to [OpenMandriva](https://www.openmandriva.org/), but I haven't decided. Honestly, I compile a lot of my own stuff anyway, so I may as well switch to [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/)
- [alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) terminal emulator (but I'm playing with [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/))
- [Azeret Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Azeret+Mono) is my favorite terminal font. It doesn't seem to be recognized by my system as a monospace font, though, so I sometimes have troube with it
- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) shell
- [boxes](https://boxes.thomasjensen.com/) text utility I use to create comment boxes in vim
- [Chordpro](https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/) creates well-formatted song sheets from ascii text
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) command-line fuzzy-finder
- [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) Window Manager, with added spice by [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom), almost all the time
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) note-taking app has a text UI available
- [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page) Window Manager, when I want something different
- [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) text editor (on rare occasion)
- [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) convertor for [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- [remind](https://dianne.skoll.ca/projects/remind/) calendar
- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) window switcher, application launcher, and dmenu replacement
- [rxvt-unicode](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html) terminal emulator, once in a while
- [slrn](https://slrn.info/) news reader
- [solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) is my preferred terminal color scheme
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/) text editor, but I'm messing about with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/) media player has a command-line interface

## I've dabbled in

- [ABC notation](https://abcnotation.com/)
- [Awk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/)
- Bash shell scripting
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Rexx](https://www.oorexx.org/index.rsp), a long time ago, when I was running OS/2 Warp. I've forgotten almost all of it.
