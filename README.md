# My configuration files ("dotfiles") for Linux

## What this repo is for

- [The best way to store your dotfiles: A bare Git repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)

## My hardware

- [ASUS ROG G75VW-AH71](https://rog.asus.com/articles/hands-on/asus-g75vw-gaming-laptop-overview/) laptop purchased in August 2013

## Some of the software I use

- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) 22.04.4 LTS "Jammy Jellyfish"
    - I'm thinking of switching to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), but I haven't decided. Honestly, I compile a lot of my own stuff anyway, so I may as well switch to [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/)
- [alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) terminal emulator
- [Azeret Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Azeret+Mono) is my favorite terminal font
- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) shell
- [boxes](https://boxes.thomasjensen.com/) text utility I use to create comment boxes in vim
- [Chordpro](https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/) creates well-formatted song sheets from ascii text
- ~~[dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) dynamic menu from suckless.org~~ (I'm switching to rofi)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) command-line fuzzy-finder
- [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) Window Manager, with added spice by [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom), almost all the time
    - If [X.org](https://x.org/wiki/) really does go away in favor of [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/), which it appears will happen, I'll likely switch to [Sway WM](https://swaywm.org/)
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) note-taking app has a text UI available
- [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page) Window Manager, when I want something different
- [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) text editor (on rare occasion)
- [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) convertor for [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- [remind](https://dianne.skoll.ca/projects/remind/) calendar
- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) window switcher, application launcher, and dmenu replacement
- [rxvt-unicode](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html) terminal emulator, once in a while
- [slrn](https://slrn.info/) news reader
- [solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) is my preferred terminal color scheme
- [suckless](https://suckless.org/) programs [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and [st](https://st.suckless.org/), but I can't say I like them
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/) text editor
- [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/) media player has a command-line interface
