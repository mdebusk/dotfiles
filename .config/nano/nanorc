# ** Options {{{
# When soft line wrapping is enabled, make it wrap lines at blank
# characters (tabs and spaces) instead of always at the edge of
# the screen.
set atblanks

# Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of
# tabs and/or spaces as the previous line (or as the next line if
# the previous line is the beginning of a paragraph).
set autoindent

# When saving a file, create a backup file by adding a
# tilde (~) to the file’s name.
set backup

# Make and keep not just one backup file, but make and keep
# a uniquely numbered one every time a file is saved -- when
# backups are enabled with set backup or --backup or -B. The
# uniquely numbered files are stored in the specified directory.
set backupdir ~/.cache/nano/backups

# Use bold instead of reverse video for the title bar, status bar,
# key combos, function tags, line numbers, and selected text. This
# can be overridden by setting the options titlecolor, statuscolor,
# keycolor, functioncolor, numbercolor, and selectedcolor.
set boldtext

# Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar. This
# overrides the option quickblank.
set constantshow

# Do not use the line below the title bar, leaving
# it entirely blank.
set emptyline

# Save the last hundred search strings and replacement strings
# and executed commands, so they can be easily reused in later
# sessions.
set historylog

# Draw a vertical stripe at the given column, to help judge the
# width of the text. (The color of the stripe can be changed with
# set stripecolor.)
set guidestripe 80

# Display line numbers to the left of the text area. (Any line with
# an anchor additionally gets a mark in the margin.)
set linenumbers

# Enable vim-style lock-files for when editing files.
set locking

# Suppress the title bar and instead show information about the
# current buffer at the bottom of the screen, in the space for the
# status bar. In this "minibar" the filename is shown on the left,
# followed by an asterisk if the buffer has been modified. On the
# right are displayed the current line and column number, the code
# of the character under the cursor (in Unicode format: U+xxxx),
# the same flags as are shown by set stateflags, and a percentage
# that expresses how far the cursor is into the file (linewise).
# When a file is loaded or saved, and also when switching between
# buffers, the number of lines in the buffer is displayed after
# the filename. This number is cleared upon the next keystroke, or
# replaced with an [i/n] counter when multiple buffers are open.
# The line plus column numbers and the character code are displayed
# only when set constantshow is used, and can be toggled on and off
# with M-C. The state flags are displayed only when set stateflags
# is used.
set minibar

# Do regular-expression searches by default. Regular expressions in
# nano are of the extended type (ERE).
set regexp          # Default to regular expression search

# Display lines that exceed the screen’s width over multiple
# screen lines. (You can make this soft-wrapping occur at
# whitespace instead of rudely at the screen’s edge, by using
# also set atblanks.)
set softwrap        # Wrap at screen width

# Use the top-right corner of the screen for showing some state
# flags: I when auto-indenting, M when the mark is on, L when
# hard-wrapping (breaking long lines), R when recording a macro,
# and S when soft-wrapping. When the buffer is modified, a star (*)
# is shown after the filename in the center of the title bar.
set stateflags

# Use a tab size of number columns. The value of number must be
# greater than 0. The default value is 8.
set tabsize 4

# Convert each typed tab to spaces -- to the number of spaces that
# a tab at that position would take up.
set tabstospaces

# Remove trailing whitespace from wrapped lines when automatic
# hard-wrapping occurs or when text is justified.
set trimblanks

# Save a file by default in Unix format. This overrides nano’s
# default behavior of saving a file in the format that it had.
# (This option has no effect when you also use set noconvert.)
set unix
