# Inspired by the following video by Rob Muhlestein (rwxrob) titled           #
# "Prefer Shell Scripts Over Plugins in Vim:"                                 #
# https://www.youtube.com/live/2o3URIxG3Zs                                    #
#                                                                             #
# I thought it was a neat idea and worth experimenting with. I also was       #
# working on learning shell scripting and was having to read in the same      #
# boilerplate text on every file when it got to where it was worth using.     #
# So I put this together to satisfy both desires.                             #
#                                                                             #
# This requires the following entry in your vimrc or some othe                #
# configuration file so as to enable the insertion of $BUFNAME:               #
